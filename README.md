# Investigate-Dataset
Project 2 from Udacity Nanodegree
## Project Overview
In this project, I have chosen a TMDB movie dataset to preform analysis on using different python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and  Matplotlib. 
## Set Up
In this project I downloaded Anaconda, which provides all the needed libraries. You will need python Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for this project.
## Process
- Download the needed data
- Pose a question
- Clean the data
- Explore the data
- Conclude findings
## Questions
1. Do popular movies have high higher ratings?
2. What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
3. Which director has directed the most top preforming movies in terms of revenue
4. Have ratings over the years fallen or increased?
## Conclusion
- Runtimes don't have a large impact on whether a movie is popular or not, but having a movie be too long can hurt it's chances.
- Larger budgets seems to preform better then ones with lower budgets.
- Popularity of the movie is a factor. The popular the movie, the higher the chance of it increasing it's revenue.
- Directors play a big role is seeing how a movie turn out. Steven Spielberg has over 20 well preforming movies in the past. He maybe the guy to call when creating a movie.
- Ratings over the years haven't changed too much.

I haven't preformed any statistical test, so there are no statistical conclusions. Just because you have a high budget doesn't mean that the movie will preform well. Correlation does not imply causation.
